Enter cost of 3 items for the useer (using float data type) - a pencil , pen & an eraser. You have to output the total cost of the items back to the user as thir bill
(you can also try to adding 18% gst tax to the items in the bill as an advanced problem)

//code 

import java.util.Scanner;

class Main{

public static void main(String args[]){

Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
       System.out.println("Enter the cost of pencil : ");
       float pencil = sc.nextFloat();
        System.out.println("Enter the cost of pen : ");
        float pen = sc.nextFloat();
         System.out.println("Enter the cost of eraser : ");
         float eraser = sc.nextFloat();
         
         float  bill = (pencil+pen+eraser);
         System.out.println("Total bill is : " + bill);
         
         //18% text 
         float newBill = total + (0.18* bill):
         System.out.println("New bill with 18% gst :" + newBill);
      
   }
   }
